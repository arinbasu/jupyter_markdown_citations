abstract = {We report ultrasensitive sub-10 nm NaMnF(3) nanocrystals codoped with Yb(3+), Er(3+)/Tm(3+) ions, and their intense pure red and near-infrared upconversion emissions in the presence of Mn(2+). The nanocrystals showed excellent T(1) contrast in 7 T MRI, implying their potential as single-phase contrast agents for fluorescent deep tissue and MR imaging.},\
